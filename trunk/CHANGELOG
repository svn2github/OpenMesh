OpenMesh 2.0-RC4 ( Rev 227 ):
* Core

- Memory leak in assignment Operator (Reported by Meng Luan, Thanks to Ilya A. Kriveshko for the patch)

* Readers/Writers
- Fixed reading ply files with unknown properties
- Added support for texture coordinates in ply files
- Add additional interface to readers/writers to use streams directly (allows direct writing to a streams)
- OMFromat  -> Fixed empty template parameter issue under msvc
- OBJReader -> Fixed loading multiple objs with material files
- OBJWriter -> Fixed writing of normals, Missing / when skipping texture coordinates


* Build system
- Added missing c files
- Build shared and static version under linux (cmake)
- Added -DBUILD_APPS=OFF cmake flag to skip building of apps (cmake)
- Added install target (cmake)
- Added doc target (cmake)
- Added doc-install target (cmake)
- Generate sonames under linux (cmake)
- Debian build dir for building Debian packages (Thanks to Jean Pierre Charalambos)
- Package generator for windows. Builds an setup file containing precompiled static libs and includes for windows.
- Throw warning if a min or max macro is defined under windows and suggest NOMINMAX (Thanks to Ingo Esser)


* Documentation
- Updated Documentation Mainpage
- Updated properties tutorial to include all request_... functions
- Updates for build instructions
- Added Tutorial on deleting geometry
- Fixed Traits example
- Other minor fixes
- Added tutorials as compileable source code

* Misc
- Updated debian dir to build debs (Thanks to Jean Pierre Charalambos)


OpenMesh 2.0-RC3 ( Rev 138 ):

* License
- Relicense under LGPL v3 with additional exception for template inclusion

* Readers/Writers
- PLY writer fix ( thanks to Marc Hugi )
- PLY reader fix ( wrong parsing of uchar binary data )
- PLY reader warnings fix ( thanks to Ilya A. Kriveshko )
- OBJ Reader now stores texture information in additional Mesh properties
- OBJ reader/writer fixes

* Tools
- Smoother now respects feature primitives
- Decimater improvements and fixes ( thanks to Ilya A. Kriveshko )

* Build system:
- Updated directory structure 
- Changed libnames to libOpenMesh and libOpenMeshTools
- cmake support
- bugfixes to qmake build system
- Keep some basic ACGMake files around ( acgmake is deprecated!! We will not provide support for it! Please use cmake or qmake instead. )

* Other
- Fixed some warnings with latest gcc
- Per halfedge texture coordinates added 
- Extended functions to get available properties
